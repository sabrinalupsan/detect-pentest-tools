This script is a part of my dissertation thesis. It is a monitoring tool that detects the usage of penetration testing tools and techniques on a machine. 
For Windows, the script detects if a registry key is modified or if Mimikatz or Winpeas are used on the local machine. For Linux, it looks for the program Linpeas or for SQL injection for an Apache2 Web Server.

To alert on suspicious behaviour, SMS messages are sent using the Twilio API to a phone number that should belong to an administrator or a security professional that can take the appropriate measures and investigate the situation.

To add the phone number, the Twilio token, paths, and any other variables, create an .env file.

Usage:
```python
python3 detectPentestTools.py
```
